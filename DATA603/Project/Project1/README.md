Before runing code_stand.ipynb, put 'TrainingData.csv' and 'TestingData.csv' under the same path as code_stand.ipynb.

Then run code_stand.ipynb block by block.

Discriptions of each question are listed under the question title. And history outcome is shown below each block.

p.s. For that sklearn seed is not fixed, the type1 error and type2 error may vary.

Thank you for reading!
